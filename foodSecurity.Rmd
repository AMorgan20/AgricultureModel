Next see what was reported during good and bad shocks in Bangladesh.

Droughts
Weather patterns - precipitation - Alex
Google Earth Engine?
Actual vs percieved? Rainfall? What does this tell us about how to interpret perceptions in terms of extreme events vs baseline.
Political events?
Illnesses
School attendance

Do people eat more water-rich foods when they have little access to water?

To Do:
Histograms of variables
What did people not want to report on
Methodology papers
